# calculator

## About
This was a project from The Odin Project. It is the final project for using the foundations learned in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The calculator includes functions for basic operations as well as a clear button.

Some capabilities include:
1. If multiple operations are strung together, the calculator will evaluate each pair of numbers one by one in the order that they are inputted.
2. If an operation is picked, but the user decides to change the operation, it will do so without computing anything.
3. Should any long decimals arise that overflow the display, the calculator will round the value in question.
4. The clear button will basically default the values.

To be included (extra credit):
1. A button for adding decimals.
2. A backspace button.
3. Nicer interface.
4. Keyboard support.

## What I learned
1. Got to be more familiar with JavaScript, HTML and CSS all around.
2. Learned more about how to use addEventListener with classes and buttons.
3. Grid-span was very helpful with styling a couple buttons.
4. Learned to make an input display.
